                        <p>I am currently living in Madison, WI and work as a Software Developer at Epic! Working for a company that is committed 
                            to improving the lives of others is really fulfilling, but whenever I have some spare time I like to pursue some 
                            of my other hobbies such as cooking, watching movies, and spending time in the great outdoors. One of my goals is to visit
                            all of the National Parks and I am roughly one-fifth of the way there! In the tech world, I'm the kind of teammate that you
                            can hand something off to and trust that it will get done. Collaborating with others and staying organized are some of my strong suits,
                            and I take a lot of pride in the work that I put my name next to. 
                        </p>
