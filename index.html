                            Hi! Thanks for checking out my website! Feel free to take a look at my work experience and some of my personal projects on the portfolio page. Otherwise,
                            read on so we can get to know eachother! Here's a little bit about me, I was born in Bulgaria and went to school in the United States. I have a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics
                            from North Carolina State University, and currently I am a full-stack Software Developer at Epic. I love hockey, F1, and cooking. I am
                            passionate about helping others and promoting equality for people that come from all walks of life. At work, I can pick things up quickly and I have
                            strong communication skills paired with a tenacious work ethic. I believe that our most important growth often happens in our most trying times, because, as
                            my dad would always tell me growing up, "Юнак без рана не може."
