            <p id="subtitle">Hello, I'm Val. I am a senior studying Computer Science and Statistics at North Carolina State University. Here's a little about me!</p>
            <br>
            <!--intro paragraph-->
            <p>Academics are a big focus for me currently, but as the college chapter of my life winds down I am ready to look ahead and plan the next chapter as a full-time software engineer. Apart from programming, I like to engage in a variety of hobbies in my spare time such as <b>hiking, making music, and working on a variety of small side projects</b>. My goal is to make a positive impact in the lives of others, and I believe that I will be able to do that best through leveraging new and emerging tech.</p>
            
            <p> This summer I worked as a Technology Analyst Summer Intern at Credit Suisse! I learned a lot about the Agile methodology, building large scale applications in Python, and how to create and grow my professional network. Looking ahead, I am searching for an entry-level software engineer position and I am ready to take initiative and make an impact!
            <br>

            <p>Below you will find a list of some of the things I've worked on.

            	<p>Rendezvous is an app that my team and I created for PackHacks 2019! We used Swift and the new Creative Kit from the Snap API (which had released only ten days prior) to build a calendar app that allows users to create events and then generates unique stickers for those events to post to social media. The app uses different image templates based on the type of event (party, sporting event, concert, etc...) and then overlays information from the event object before exporting it to Snapchat. We had the good fortune of winning the <b>MLH award for "Best Use of Snapkit"</b>!  We plan to continue working on this app and adding new features.

            	<p class="lead">Spotify Genre Classification</p>
            	<p> In our Introduction to Data Analysis class, we had a semester-long project to implement the machine learning techniques that we had learned in class in a novel way. My group decided to use the Spotify Web API to tackle the problem of how to classify songs into a genre using audio features that are calculated in-house by Spotify and made available through their API. The part that I was involved with was data preprocessing and analysis. We used a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to reach an accuracy rate as high as 84% on a test set of roughly 200 songs. Machine Learning fascinates me because we can use to find these hidden connections that are so novel and exciting when discovered! You can see the final presentation we gave to our class <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VG81ieMQse3GKyyKU7f_N0eLJ-DHkFGZvP3SjcNY5WU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

              <p class="lead">Spectrum Music Visualizer<p>
              <p>Spectrum is a real-time music visualizer that I created in the autumn of 2017 during a bit of downtime that I had. I was curious
              to learn a little bit about how Unity works and to apply some of the C# I had learned at my last internship in a more creative way.
              The project works by pulling a fixed amount of bytes of audio data per time interval and using a wave transform to those values to get numbers I can work with. Once I have reasonable numerical values I use those to scale the ring of cubes, doing so once per time interval.
              This all happens so fast and so frequently that you end up with the illusion of smooth movement. I applied some tutorials that I found online to help get this working and I am happy with the result!</p>

              <p>The PyBot known as Stock Thought is a project I just wrapped up. My idea was to use the Reddit and Twitter APIs to make a bot that
              scours top posts on personal finance and stock market subreddits and tweets the most upvoted comments it can find every 30 minutes. This is my first project with Python
              I've had a lot of fun teaching myself how to develop with all the new tools that are at my disposal. Ultimately, you should try and do work that is interesting to you, and I'm very interested in finances and the economy.
              Its not the most useful forecasting, but who doesn't want to read esoteric stock prophecies every so often? </p>

              <p class="lead">Smart Mirror<p>
              <p>This past summer, my girlfriend and I built a smart mirror together. A smart mirror is a one-way mirror with a monitor behind it
              that is projecting information. We configured a Raspberry Pi with the <a href="https://magicmirror.builders/" target="_blank">MagicMirror</a> open-source software and configured some modules
              that we thought were interesting. It currently displays calendar events, date and time, weather and news updates, and a new quote every hour. It has been installed in my living room for almost half a year now and I've become
              completely spoiled because of it. I plan on adding support for Amazon's Alexa at some point down the line. Check out some of the pictures below of the final product!</p>
