                            Developed internal chatbot for financial data as part of a small Agile team. Built primarily in Python and Flask, the chatbot leverages 
                            the Microsoft QnaMaker and LUIS ML services for sophisticated user interaction. On the team, I was responsible for 
                            the web-scraping and data-parsing components as well as integration with the aforementioned third-party ML services.
                            Our team presented and successfully handed-off product for further development and internal deployment.

                                Cloudinator (rename pending) is an open-source automation platform written in Python that allows developers to  
                                deploy and manage their Linux-based applications on various cloud platforms. I was part of the initial team led by Michael 
                                DeHaan (RedHat, Ansible) during my last semester at NC State. I implemented support for multiple AWS resources such as 
                                AutoScaling Group and Elastic Load Balancer, the initial logic for Blue/Green Deployment Upgrades, and VPC/BastionHost support for custom cloud topologies.

                            Network Security was one of my favorite classes that I took as an undergrad, and one of the things we learned about in that class
                            was blockchain technology. I found myself inspired to learn more about how cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology and 
                            tried my hand at creating my very own simple cryptocurrency in Python! Valerium is the result of that effort, it is a simple
                            cryptocurrency that allows users to commit transactions, mine blocks, and reach consensus via Flask endpoints. Valerium 
                            is never going to ICO, it's just a proof-of-concept unless...

                            At PackHacks 2019, myself and three of my best friends created an app called Rendezvous which won the 
                            competition's MLH "Best Use of Snapkit" Award! We used Swift and the new Creative Kit from the Snap API 
                            (which had released only ten days prior) to prototype a calendar app that allowed users to auto-generate 
                            unique stickers for their selected calendar events and post them to Snapchat.
