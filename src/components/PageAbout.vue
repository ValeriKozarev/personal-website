        I am a first-generation immigrant from Bulgaria currently working as a Software Engineer in the United States. I studied Computer Science and Statistics at NC State University in Raleigh, NC. I have experience in a variety of industries and with a variety of technologies. Currently, I am really interested in front-end development and cloud computing.

        I care deeply about the climate crisis, as well as the current health and wealth inequalities in the United States.

        I really enjoy drinking coffee, playing guitar, and spending time in the great outdoors.
