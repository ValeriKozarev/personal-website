This repo holds my current personal website, after I finish it I plan on going back through and updating it to be responsive! Check out the legacy branch to see what my website used to look like before I knew anything about CSS!

Current TODOs:
1. make the header a bit nicer and more responsive  
1.5. fix spacing so everything fits on a phone screen  
2. add custom fonts
3. add portfolio page
