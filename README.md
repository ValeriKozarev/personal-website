This repo holds my current personal website! Feel free to take a look around. I'd say my understanding of HTML and CSS has come a long way since I first created a website but you can see for yourself by going to the legacy branch! Massive thanks to Jeff Nguyen, a good friend of mine who's website was a massive help in helping me fix issues when I got stuck and to this WordPen demo by Eric Porter which I used as the basis for my intro: https://codepen.io/EricPorter/pen/JjPmOOb.

Current TODOs:
1. add custom fonts
2. add portfolio page
